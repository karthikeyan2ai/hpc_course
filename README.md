# hpc_course
some of hpc parallel programming code
# assigmnet 1: Fibonacci series with openmp
Used shared variable and critical and calculated time taken for different number of threads unfortunately time taken increases with thread
# Result 
Time taken with 1 threads: 3 microseconds
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 
Time taken with 2 threads: 59 microseconds
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 
Time taken with 3 threads: 51 microseconds
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 
Time taken with 4 threads: 96 microseconds
# code needs to evaluated again
