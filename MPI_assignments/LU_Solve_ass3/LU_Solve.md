### LU Solve Problem explained

The LU decomposition of a matrix A can be represented as A = LU, where L is a lower triangular matrix and U is an upper triangular matrix. The LU decomposition can be computed using various algorithms, such as Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting.

Once the LU decomposition is obtained, solving a linear system Ax = b can be done in two steps:

Forward substitution: Solve the lower triangular system Ly = b for y. This can be done by substituting the values of y_i as they are computed from the equations in L.

Backward substitution: Solve the upper triangular system Ux = y for x. This can be done by substituting the values of x_i as they are computed from the equations in U.
